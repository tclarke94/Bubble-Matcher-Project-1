This is a simple memory matching flash card game made with HTML, CSS< and Javascript. The goal is to click matching boxes in order to rack up a high score. There are 12 boxes with 6 differnet colors hidden underneath to find. There is a scoreboard to keep track of matched squares.

My users would be anyone who wants to play the game. Ideally the user experience would consist of a playable matching game where when two matching squares are clicked the score goes up. When non-matching squares are clicked the match is not recognized and the score does not increase.

I had issues with the logic for recognizing matching squares as well as non-matching squares. It recognizes when they are matching or not and gives points, but it does not flip back non-matching cards which is not ideal.
